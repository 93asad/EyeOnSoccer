#EyeOnSoccer
This is an android project entirely written in java (android app can be written in C# too. See my HELPS project). It is a football app that currently featues five major leagues: Premier league, spanish league, Italian league and bundeslia. App has following features:
- See current league table
- See upcomming schedule or previous results for entire league/specific team
- See upcomming schedule or previous results for specific month
- See news for entire league or for specific team in a league

Planning to add: reminders for matches and profiles for each team.
